executive-summary Executive Summary


Based on your updated household (2 adults, 2 children) and priorities, the best option is overwhelmingly Scenario 2: Enroll the entire family in the Zaxby's OAP 3000 plan.
This strategy is the clear winner for your family:
* Best for Ozempic: It provides the predictable, low-cost pharmacy coverage you need. The copay for Ozempic is estimated at $35 per month 1, compared to the $50-$125 monthly maximum on the USG plan2.

* Lowest Total Cost: This scenario has the lowest monthly premium by a slim margin, saving you approximately **$11.50/month** ($138/year) over the next-best "Split Coverage" option (Scenario 4).
* No Surcharge: By enrolling the family in the Zaxby's plan, you completely avoid the $150/month USG spouse surcharge3.

* Simplicity: It places the entire family on a single plan, simplifying administration, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums.
The primary trade-off is a higher family out-of-pocket maximum ($14,000)44. However, for your stated needs (predictable Rx costs and low-to-moderate use), the immediate and substantial monthly savings and superior pharmacy benefits make this the most logical choice.

	**$7,393.92** *($6,374 + $420 Rx + $600 visits/labs)*
	Illustrative Use Assumptions:
   * Ozempic: Assumed to be Tier 2 (Preferred Brand) for one adult.
   * Moderate Use (Plan A): $10,356 (Annual Premium) + $1,500 (Ozempic) + $100 (4x $25 PCP) + $50 (1x $50 Specialist) + $100 (2x $50 UC) + $80 (10% of $800 labs, assuming deductible met).
   * Moderate Use (Plan B): $6,236 (Annual Premium) + $420 (Ozempic) + $100 (4x $25 PCP) + $50 (1x $50 Specialist) + $100 (2x $50 UC) + $300 (100% of $300 labs, as it's pre-deductible).
   * Note: The lab cost difference is due to Plan A's 10% coinsurance after deductible vs. Plan B's 20% coinsurance after deductible. In a moderate use case on Plan B, the $6,000 family deductible is not met, so you pay 100% of labs. On Plan A, it's ambiguous, but I've assumed the deductible is met for labs. If not, the lab cost would be higher, making Plan A even more expensive.

	91 / 100
	Recommendations:
This is a very close race between Scenario 2 and Scenario 4, both of which are excellent choices that meet your needs.
   * 🥇 Best Overall: Scenario 2 (All on Zaxby's OAP 3000). It is the simplest and cheapest option. It puts everyone on one plan with one deductible and provides the $35 Ozempic copay and $0 telehealth visits.
   * 🥈 Excellent Alternative: Scenario 4 (Split, Kids on Zaxby's). This is also a fantastic choice. It costs only ~$11.50/mo more but gives you two separate out-of-pocket maximums ($5k for the USG employee, $14k for the Zaxby's family). This slightly reduces your total high-end financial risk compared to putting all four people on the single $14k Zaxby's plan.
   * 💸 Best Budget: Scenario 2 (All on Zaxby's OAP 3000).
   * 💊 Best for Predictable Rx: Scenario 2 or Scenario 4 (Tie).
Final Verdict: Go with Scenario 2 (All on Zaxby's OAP 3000). The minor cost savings and significant administrative simplicity of having one family plan outweigh the slightly lower (but more complex) out-of-pocket risk of Scenario 4.

⚠️ Assumptions & Edge Cases


Please be aware of the following assumptions made during this analysis:
   1. Year Mismatch: The USG plan is for 2025 51, and the Zaxby's plan is for 202652. This analysis assumes the Zaxby's 2026 rates and benefits are what you would be enrolling in.

   2. Pay Periods: The Zaxby's guide provides rates "Per Pay Period"53. I have assumed a bi-weekly (26 pay periods) schedule to calculate monthly premiums. If the pay schedule is different (e.g., weekly or semi-monthly), the monthly premium for Plan B will change.

   3. Ozempic Tier: I have assumed Ozempic (semaglutide) is a Tier 2 (Preferred Brand) on both plans. If it is classified as Tier 3 (Non-Preferred), the annual cost on Plan B would increase from $420 to $900 (from $75/mo copays 54). This is still more predictable and cheaper than Plan A's $1,500 annual estimate.
