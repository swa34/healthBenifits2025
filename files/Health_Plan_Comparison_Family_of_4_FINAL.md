# Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan Comparison Analysis
## USG (Plan A) vs. Zaxby's (Plan B) - FAMILY OF 4

**Analysis Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Household:** Two non-smoking adults + Two children  
**Key Need:** One adult uses Ozempic (semaglutide) - requires predictable pharmacy copays

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Recommendations (Top 5)

1. **RECOMMENDED: Scenario 3 - Entire Family on Zaxby's OAP 1700 - BEST OVERALL**
   - **Total Cost: $559.95/month ($6,719/year) with NO surcharge**
   - Superior pharmacy benefits with predictable $35-$75 copays for Ozempic
   - Estimated total annual cost: $8,519-$9,219 (including Rx and moderate medical use)
   - Clean administration - one family plan covering all four members

2. **CRITICAL SURCHARGE WARNING: USG's $150/month penalty makes joint coverage expensive**
   - The working-spouse surcharge adds **$1,800/year** to any USG plan covering both spouses
   - This surcharge applies because spouse has access to Zaxby's subsidized coverage
   - Cannot be avoided unless spouse declines Zaxby's eligibility entirely

3. **Pharmacy Predictability: Zaxby's non-HDHP plans are superior for Ozempic**
   - Zaxby's OAP plans: **$420-900/year** for Ozempic (flat copays)
   - USG Comprehensive/BlueChoice: **$2,100/year** (20% coinsurance on specialty tier)
   - This $1,200-1,680/year difference is substantial for chronic medication needs

4. **Avoid All HDHP Plans for This Household**
   - HDHPs require meeting full family deductibles ($3,500-$9,000) before ANY Rx coverage
   - Ozempic cost would be ~$1,000/month until deductible met = massive cash flow burden
   - Even with HSA contributions, unpredictable costs create financial stress

5. **Alternative: Scenario 1 (Split Family) saves ~$100/month vs. USG family coverage**
   - User + kids on Zaxby's OAP 1700: $559.95/month
   - Spouse on own Zaxby's plan: $163.39/month
   - Total: $723.34/month vs. $863.04 on USG Comprehensive with surcharge
   - But adds administrative complexity vs. unified Zaxby's family plan

## DETAILED SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Scenario 1: Split Configuration - User + Kids on Zaxby's, Spouse Separate

**Configuration:**
- **User + 2 Children:** Zaxby's OAP 1700 (Employee + Child[ren] tier)
- **Spouse:** Zaxby's OAP 1700 (Employee Only tier) - separate enrollment
- **Spouse Surcharge:** $0 (no one is covering a spouse with external coverage)

**Monthly Premiums:**
- Zaxby's OAP 1700 (Employee + Children): $327.60
- Zaxby's OAP 1700 (Spouse Employee Only): $163.39
- Spouse Surcharge: $0.00
- **TOTAL MONTHLY PREMIUM: $490.99**
- **ANNUAL PREMIUM: $5,892**

**Pharmacy Coverage for Ozempic:**
- Under Zaxby's OAP 1700: Tier 2 or 3
- Must meet $1,700 individual deductible first (if user is taking Ozempic)
- After deductible: $35-$75 per 30-day fill
- **Estimated Annual Ozempic Cost: $1,700 (deductible) + $420-900 (copays) = $2,120-2,600**

**Medical Cost-Sharing Examples:**
| Service | User/Kids Plan | Spouse Plan |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| PCP Visit | $25 copay | $25 copay |
| Specialist | $50 copay | $50 copay |
| ER | $350 copay | $350 copay |
| Inpatient (e.g., $30K bill) | Pay $1,700 ded + 20% of remainder = $7,360 max OOP | Pay $1,700 ded + 20% = $5,100 max OOP each |

**Illustrative Total Annual Costs:**
| Utilization Level | Annual Premium | Ozempic | Medical Services | **TOTAL** |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Low Use** (2 PCP, 1 specialist across family) | $5,892 | $2,600 | $175 | **$8,667** |
| **Moderate** (Low + urgent care + labs + 1 imaging) | $5,892 | $2,600 | $1,200 | **$9,692** |
| **Higher** (Moderate + 1 ER visit or hospitalization) | $5,892 | $2,600 | $3,500 | **$11,992** |

**Pros:**
- Lowest monthly premium of all scenarios ($490.99)
- No spouse surcharge
- Excellent pharmacy predictability for Ozempic (flat copays)
- Two separate deductibles and OOP maxes may help if high utilization

**Cons:**
- Administrative complexity - managing two separate plan enrollments
- Must meet separate deductibles for user plan ($1,700) and spouse plan ($1,700)
- Family deductible is effectively $3,400 minimum before coinsurance kicks in
- Ozempic user must pay full deductible + copays (no benefit from "embedded" family deductible)

### Scenario 2: Entire Family on USG Comprehensive Care (with Surcharge)

**Configuration:**
- **All 4 family members:** USG Anthem Comprehensive Care (Family tier)
- **Spouse Surcharge:** **$150/month APPLIES** (spouse has access to Zaxby's subsidized coverage)

**Monthly Premiums:**
- USG Comprehensive Care (Family): $713.04
- **Working Spouse Surcharge: $150.00**
- **TOTAL MONTHLY PREMIUM: $863.04**
- **ANNUAL PREMIUM: $10,356**

**Pharmacy Coverage for Ozempic:**
- Under USG Comprehensive Care: Specialty tier
- NO deductible required for specialty drugs
- Cost: 20% coinsurance with $175 maximum per fill
- **Estimated Annual Ozempic Cost: $2,100** (12 × $175)

**Medical Cost-Sharing:**
- Family deductible: $4,500 (embedded - each person has $1,500 individual max)
- After deductible: 90% covered / 10% member pays
- Family OOP max: $6,600 (medical) + $6,000 (pharmacy) = **$12,600 potential max**

**Medical Cost Examples:**
| Service | Member Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| PCP Visit | $25 copay (no deductible) |
| Specialist | $50 copay (no deductible) |
| ER | $300 copay (waived if admitted) |
| Inpatient ($30K) | Pay deductible + 10% coinsurance up to OOP max |

**Illustrative Total Annual Costs:**
| Utilization Level | Annual Premium | Ozempic | Medical Services | **TOTAL** |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Low Use** | $10,356 | $2,100 | $200 | **$12,656** |
| **Moderate** | $10,356 | $2,100 | $900 | **$13,356** |
| **Higher** | $10,356 | $2,100 | $3,500 | **$15,956** |

**Pros:**
- Single family plan - easiest administration
- No deductible on specialty drugs (Ozempic)
- Moderate Ozempic cost ($2,100/year)
- Strong out-of-network coverage if needed
- Embedded deductible (each member maxes at $1,500)

**Cons:**
- **MOST EXPENSIVE OPTION: $10,356/year in premiums**
- $150/month surcharge adds $1,800/year unnecessarily
- Separate pharmacy OOP max creates dual exposure
- Ozempic cost $1,200-1,680 higher than Zaxby's annually
- Total worst-case OOP: $12,600 (dual OOP maxes)

---

### Scenario 3: Entire Family on Zaxby's OAP 1700 ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

**Configuration:**
- **All 4 family members:** Zaxby's OAP 1700 (Family tier)
- **Spouse Surcharge:** $0 (Zaxby's has no surcharge policy)

**Monthly Premiums:**
- Zaxby's OAP 1700 (Family): $559.95
- Spouse Surcharge: $0.00
- **TOTAL MONTHLY PREMIUM: $559.95**
- **ANNUAL PREMIUM: $6,719**

**Pharmacy Coverage for Ozempic:**
- Under Zaxby's OAP 1700: Assumed Tier 2 (Preferred Brand) or Tier 3 (Non-Preferred)
- **Must meet medical deductible first:** $1,700 individual or $5,100 family
- After deductible: $35 copay (Tier 2) or $75 copay (Tier 3) per 30-day fill
- **Estimated Annual Ozempic Cost:**
  - **Best case (Tier 2):** $1,700 deductible + (12 × $35) = $2,120
  - **Likely case (Tier 3):** $1,700 deductible + (12 × $75) = $2,600

**Medical Cost-Sharing:**
- Family deductible: $5,100 (embedded - each person has $1,700 individual max)
- After deductible: 80% covered / 20% member pays
- Family OOP max: $15,300 (includes both medical and pharmacy)

**Medical Cost Examples:**
| Service | Member Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| PCP Visit | $25 copay (no deductible) |
| Specialist | $50 copay (no deductible) |
| ER | $350 copay (waived if admitted) |
| Inpatient ($30K) | Pay toward deductible + 20% coinsurance up to $15,300 OOP max |
| Preventive Care | 100% covered |

**Illustrative Total Annual Costs:**
| Utilization Level | Annual Premium | Ozempic | Medical Services | **TOTAL** |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Low Use** (2 PCP, 1 spec, preventive for kids) | $6,719 | $2,600 | $200 | **$9,519** |
| **Moderate** (Low + urgent care + labs + imaging) | $6,719 | $2,600 | $1,000 | **$10,319** |
| **Higher** (Moderate + ER or minor procedure) | $6,719 | $2,600 | $2,500 | **$11,819** |

**Pros:**
- ✅ **LOWEST total annual cost across all scenarios**
- ✅ **Single family plan - simplest administration**
- ✅ **NO spouse surcharge - saves $1,800/year vs USG**
- ✅ **Excellent Rx predictability** - flat $35-75 copays after deductible
- ✅ **$1,200-1,500 lower Ozempic cost** vs USG annually
- ✅ **Single combined OOP max** (no separate Rx OOP trap)
- ✅ Embedded deductible structure protects each family member

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Must meet $1,700 individual deductible before Ozempic copays apply
- ⚠️ Higher coinsurance (20%) than USG Comprehensive (10%) for major medical
- ⚠️ High family OOP maximum ($15,300) - but unlikely to hit in most years
- ⚠️ Limited out-of-network coverage vs USG PPO

**Bottom Line:** This scenario offers the best balance of cost, simplicity, and pharmacy predictability for your household.

### Scenario 4: Entire Family on Zaxby's OAP 3000 (Lower Premium Alternative)

**Configuration:**
- **All 4 family members:** Zaxby's OAP 3000 (Family tier)
- **Spouse Surcharge:** $0

**Monthly Premiums:**
- Zaxby's OAP 3000 (Family): $519.63
- Spouse Surcharge: $0.00
- **TOTAL MONTHLY PREMIUM: $519.63**
- **ANNUAL PREMIUM: $6,236**

**Pharmacy Coverage for Ozempic:**
- Same as OAP 1700: $35-75 copay after meeting deductible
- **Must meet higher deductible:** $3,000 individual or $9,000 family
- **Estimated Annual Ozempic Cost: $3,000-3,900** (higher deductible)

**Medical Cost-Sharing:**
- Higher deductible: $3,000 individual / $9,000 family (embedded)
- **Worse coinsurance:** 70% covered / **30% member pays**
- Higher family OOP max: $18,000

**Illustrative Total Annual Costs:**
| Utilization Level | Annual Premium | Ozempic | Medical Services | **TOTAL** |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Low Use** | $6,236 | $3,900 | $200 | **$10,336** |
| **Moderate** | $6,236 | $3,900 | $1,500 | **$11,636** |
| **Higher** | $6,236 | $3,900 | $4,000 | **$14,136** |

**Analysis:** While this has the lowest premium ($519.63/month), the significantly higher deductible and worse coinsurance (70/30 vs 80/20) make it a poor choice for a household with ongoing Ozempic needs. The higher deductible adds ~$1,300/year to Ozempic costs alone, negating the $40/month premium savings.

**Verdict:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Higher deductible undermines pharmacy predictability

## ASSUMPTIONS & EDGE CASES

### Critical Assumptions Made:

1. **Ozempic Formulary Placement:**
   - **USG Plans:** Assumed "Specialty Tier" based on typical GLP-1 agonist classification
     - Basis: GLP-1 drugs often fall under specialty due to cost and administration
     - Cost: 20% coinsurance with $175 maximum per 30-day fill (per page 22)
     - Risk: Could be Tier 2 or 3 if formulary classifies differently; would reduce cost
   
   - **Zaxby's Plans:** Assumed "Tier 2 (Preferred Brand)" or "Tier 3 (Non-Preferred)"
     - Basis: Most formularies classify GLP-1s as brand drugs, not specialty
     - Cost range: $35-75 per 30-day fill after deductible
     - Risk: Could require specialty tier if formulary differs; need to verify

2. **Prior Authorization:**
   - Assumed likely required for both plans due to prevalence of PA requirements for GLP-1s
   - Medical necessity documentation typically needed (diabetes diagnosis or other criteria)
   - Step therapy may apply (try metformin or other drugs first)
   - **Action needed:** Verify PA requirements with both CVS Caremark and ProAct before enrollment

3. **Deductible Application:**
   - **Zaxby's:** Confirmed that Rx copays apply AFTER meeting medical deductible (page 5 shows "Subject to Medical Deductible")
   - **USG:** Confirmed specialty drugs do NOT require deductible (page 22)
   - This creates first-year cash flow consideration for Zaxby's plans

4. **Surcharge Applicability:**
   - Assumed spouse surcharge APPLIES to all USG scenarios where spouse is covered
   - Basis: Spouse works at Zaxby's, which offers subsidized health coverage
   - Exception: Surcharge does NOT apply if spouse declines Zaxby's eligibility entirely
   - **Caveat:** If spouse leaves Zaxby's employment, surcharge would no longer apply

5. **Premium Conversion (Zaxby's):**
   - Converted biweekly (per pay period) rates to monthly using factor of 2.1667
   - Calculation: 26 pay periods per year ÷ 12 months = 2.1667
   - Verified: Annual costs derived both ways match

6. **Network Coverage:**
   - Assumed both Anthem (USG) and AmeriBen (Zaxby's) have adequate networks in Athens, GA area
   - Out-of-network coverage noted where applicable but not deeply analyzed
   - **Action needed:** Verify current doctors are in-network before enrollment

7. **Children's Coverage:**
   - Assumed both children are under age 26 and eligible for dependent coverage
   - Assumed no special needs or chronic conditions for children (only adult needs Ozempic)
   - If children have significant medical needs, scenario analysis may shift

### Edge Cases to Consider:

**Case 1: Mid-Year Employment Change**
- If either spouse changes employers mid-year, it triggers a Qualifying Life Event (QLE)
- Could allow switching plans outside open enrollment
- Surcharge rules would need re-evaluation

**Case 2: Ozempic Indication Change**
- If prescription changes from diabetes (typically covered) to weight loss only (often NOT covered)
- Coverage may be denied entirely
- Would dramatically change scenario scores

**Case 3: High Medical Year**
- If family incurs major medical event (surgery, hospitalization, etc.)
- Separate Rx OOP max on USG plans becomes significant negative ($12,600 total exposure)
- Zaxby's single OOP max ($15,300) provides better protection despite higher amount

**Case 4: Manufacturer Copay Assistance**
- If Novo Nordisk (Ozempic manufacturer) offers copay cards/assistance
- May significantly reduce out-of-pocket costs on either plan
- USG notes copay cards are allowed (page 24)
- **Action needed:** Check www.novocare.com for current savings programs

**Case 5: Mail Order Requirements**
- Some plans require or incentivize 90-day mail order for maintenance drugs
- Mail order copays differ from retail (lower on all plans analyzed)
- Ozempic may not qualify for 90-day supply due to storage/handling requirements
